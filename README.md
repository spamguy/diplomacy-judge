# dipl.io Judge [DEPRECATED]
A Diplomacy adjudicator written as a NodeJS module.

---

The dipl.io judge is a NodeJS module written to adjudicate Diplomacy games. Although written primarily for [dipl.io](https://dipl.io), it can be used in any NodeJS application that supplies data in an expected format.

**January 12, 2016:**
This module is no longer in development. Porting is imperfect, slow work, and adapting it for dipl.io's purposes doubly so. Please see [spamguy/diplomacy-godip](https://github.com/spamguy/diplomacy-godip) for the judge now in use, which is JavaScript code directly generated from the Golang original.
